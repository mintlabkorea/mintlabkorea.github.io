    description:
      "We advance robot intelligence through foundation models and world models that enable robots to perceive, reason, and act in complex physical environments. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models allow robots to ground language understanding in real-world manipulation and locomotion. Our world models learn physics-aware representations of environments, supporting sim-to-real transfer and long-horizon planning. We apply these approaches across manipulation, humanoid control, autonomous vehicles and racing, and multi-agent systems — combining multimodal sensing (vision, tactile, proprioception) with deep reinforcement learning and computer vision.",

    description:
      "We develop AI-driven approaches for continuous health monitoring and assistive robotics. By combining wearable sensor data (IMU, EMG, pressure insoles) with foundation models, we enable real-time estimation of body kinematics, kinetics, and activity states across everyday settings. These capabilities power adaptive control of exoskeletons and wearable robotic systems — interpreting user intent and delivering coordinated assistance for rehabilitation and mobility enhancement. Our world models learn to predict human movement dynamics, enabling proactive and personalized interventions.",

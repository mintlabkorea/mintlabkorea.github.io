The goal of our lab is to develop intelligent algorithms capable of understanding various aspects of human states - such as body kinematics, kinetics, activities, and intentions. Furthermore, drawing upon our understandings of human states, we aim to design robotics and digital healthcare systems that offer benefits to humans.
